# mcp-endpoint-exploration

A professional-development-day investigation. _(2025-September-15-Monday)_

Goal: to explore the process of setting up a [Model-Context-Protocol (MCP)][mcp] endpoint, using the [BDR-APIs][bdr-apis] as the target data-source.

For context... From a previous professional-development-day [investigation][pre-inv], I learned about MCP. In a nutshell, it's a protocol for how an LLM can use tools to look up information. In that investigation, I learned a bit about how to configure an LLM to access an MCP server, and installed endpoint-tools created by others.

In this investigation, I'd like to understand what's involved in _creating_ one of those MCP tools. I'd like to use the public BDR-APIs as the data-source for the tools. The idea is that one would be able to converse with an LLM, and depending upon what's asked, the LLM would know when (and how) it should query the BDR-MCP-tool -- and that tool would know how to use the BDR-APIs to get data to answer questions.
